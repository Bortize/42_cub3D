The cub3D is a project belonging to the 42 programming campus and the whole network.

This project is inspired by the game Wolfenstein of the 90s, which was the first FPS in history. The purpose of this challenge is to develop a program that simulates the operation of this famous video game.

The main objective is to control the ray casting technique and apply it to the program
